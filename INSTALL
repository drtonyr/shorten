Building shorten
================

There is no configuration file for this package, just type make to get a
single executable called "shorten".  The default C compiler is set to
cc with optimisation -O.  Please choose as you like - for example:

	make CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -funroll-loops"

Testing shorten
===============

A quick test may be performed with:

	make test

Installing shorten
==================

For a standard system:

	make install

will place shorten in /usr/local/bin and shorten.1 in /usr/local/man/man1.

The make variables prefix and maxext can be set for non-standard
environments, for example:

	make prefix=$HOME maxext=l

Other documentation
===================

A more readable version of the UNIX man page is contained in shorten.man.

A technical report on shorten is included as tr156.tex and tr156.ps.

Current bugs
============

There are no known problems with this code.

The MSDOS version lacks the automatic generation of filenames, this is
not a bug a `feature' due to the 8.3 naming convention of MSDOS.  If you
know of a good workaround please tell me.

If you have any problems, please tell me and I'll do my best to fix them.
